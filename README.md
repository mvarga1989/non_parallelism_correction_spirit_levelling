# non_parallelism_correction_spirit_levelling
Calculates the non parallelism correction to spirit levelling.

If you do not have measured gravity at height stations, you might need to correct the line between points for the non-parallelism, as the equipotential surfaces are not parallel due to complex distribution of the Earth's masses.
